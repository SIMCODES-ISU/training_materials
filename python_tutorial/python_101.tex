\TwoColumnSlide{Notes on Writing Python}
{\BulletList{
	\item Case-sensitive, e.g., \texttt{Print} is not the same as \texttt{print}
	\item Leading spaces are significant (and should always be spaces, \textbf{NOT} tabs).
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The number of spaces is up to you, but you should be consistent.
		\item e.g., if you choose to indent two spaces, you should always use two space.
	\end{itemize}
	\item The type of brackets, braces, etc. are significant.

\TwoColumnSlide{What is a Notebook?}
{\BulletList{
	\item Examples are Colab and Jupyter.
	\item Notebooks are single files (\texttt{*.ipynb} extensions).
	\item Notebooks are designed for singe use.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item E.g., tutorials, data analysis, rapid prototyping.  
	\end{itemize}
	\item NOT intended for reuse, or further development.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Can force it if you really want to...
	\end{itemize} 
}}
{
}

\TwoColumnSlide{What is a Module?}
{
\BulletList{
	\item Python software has three flavors: modules, packages, and libraries.
	\item A module is a single \texttt{*.py} file.
	\item Modules are building blocks of packages and libraries.
	\item All the actual effort goes into writing modules.
}}
{}
{}


\TwoColumnSlide{What is a Package?}
{\BulletList{
        \item Packages are modules distributed together.
	\item Directory, \texttt{\_\_init\_\_.py} file, and \texttt{*.py} files.
	\item Name of the directory will be the name of the package.
	\item The \texttt{\_\_init\_\_.py} file is usually empty, but is essential because
	         that's how Python determines your directory is a package.
	\item The \texttt{*.py} files are plain text and are where you put the code. 
}}
{
}
{}

\TwoColumnSlide{What is a Library?}
{\BulletList{
	\item Libraries are packages that are distributed together.
	\item Libraries are usually distributed individually so the
	        terms stop here.
	\item We won't worry about how to develop a library.
}}
{}
{}

\TwoColumnSlide{What is a project?}
{\BulletList{
	\item Disclaimer, may not be a standardized term.
	\item Modules, packages, and libraries are ``just the code.''
	\item Good software also ``infrastructure'', e.g., documentation, tests, etc.
	\item We call everything together the ``project.''
}}
{}
{}

\TwoColumnSlide{Fibonacci Sequence}
{\BulletList{
	\item 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, $\ldots$
	\item $F_i = F_{i-2} + F_{i-1}$
	\item Our goal: write a package for computing $F_i$.
}}
{}
{}

\TwoColumnSlide{Setup: Project Structure}
{\BulletList{
	\item<1-> Let's call our project \texttt{Fibby}
	\item<1-> In terminal, start by making a directory called \texttt{fibby}.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<1-> Note it is lowercase to avoid file system gotchas.	
	\end{itemize}
	\item<1-> What is the terminal command for creating \texttt{fibby}?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<2-> \inlinecode{mkdir fibby}
	\end{itemize}
	\item<3> All of our project files will live inside this directory.
	\item<3> Practice: add \texttt{fibby/README.md} with contents:
	        \inlinecode{Welcome to Fibby!}
	\item<3> N.b., paths for this tutorial are given relative to the first \texttt{fibby}
	               directory you made.
}}
{}
{}

\TwoColumnSlide{Setup: Package Structure}
{\BulletList{
	\item Within a project, Python modules are separated from infrastructure.
	\item Python modules for a package are stored in a single directory.
	\item Python uses the directory name as the name of the package.
	\item Unfortunately this leads to a very common pattern where the name of
	         the project and the name of the package are the same.
	\item I.e., add a directory \texttt{fibby/fibby}
}}

\TwoColumnSlide{Development Notes}
{\BulletList{
	\item When you develop software you typically don't call your function, class, etc. in the module
	         you define it in.

\TwoColumnSlide{Performance}

\TwoColumnSlide{Performance: Lesson}

\TwoColumnSlide{Documentation}
{\BulletList{
	\item I recommend adding documentation as the last step before a PR.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If you add it too early, you'll often find that you need to change it because
		         you added/removed a parameter, changed the type of a parameter, etc.
	\end{itemize}
	\item In Python we document functions with ``docstrings''.
	\item Docstrings are free-form, but in science we usually follow ``numpydoc'' style.

\TwoColumnSlide{Generalizing}
{\BulletList{
	\item While real-world problems are harder, they're tackled basically the same way.
         \item Write code units (e.g., function, class, libraries) for each task.
         \item Test the code units as you write them.
         \item If code unit gets too big, split it.
         \item Document before committing.
}}
{}
{}

\TwoColumnSlide{Misc.}
{\BulletList{
	\item Software engineering is ultimately a soft science.
	\item Should this be a function? A class? A library? Subjective.
	\item Ultimately, any solution that gets the right answer 
	         (for the right reasons) is ``correct''.
	\item Easier to test small code units. I recommend erring on the
	         side of too small, rather than too large.
	\item A lot like ``showing your work'' in math. Each code unit shows
	         a step. 
	\item As you get more comfortable you can start ``skipping steps.''

\TwoColumnSlide{Debugging}
{\BulletList{
	\item In practice, most of coding is debugging.
	\item Something you get better at with practice.
	\item Need to trace the logic of the program and see where if fails.
	\item Usually introduced through \inlinecode{print} statements.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Basically print values until you find the first one that
		         is wrong.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Tools called ``debuggers'' that can do this (and more) for
	         you.

\TwoColumnSlide{Practice}
{\BulletList{
	\item Fibonacci sequence prototypical example of recursion.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Recursion: Function \texttt{fibonacci} calls itself.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Goal: write the call for $F_i$ in terms of the calls for
	         $F_{i-2}$ and $F_{i-1}$.
	\item Hint: in terminal \texttt{ctrl + c} kills the current running
	         process.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Common recursion problem is running forever because
		         function just keeps calling itself.
